## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Open your browser** and navigate to the provided local URL

## 🎮 How to Use

### Quick Start
1. Click the **Play** button to start the vehicle simulation
2. Watch the blue vehicle marker move along the route
3. Use speed controls to adjust simulation speed (0.5x to 4x)
4. Click **Pause** to pause or **Reset** to restart from the beginning

### Control Panel
- **Play/Pause Button**: Start or stop the vehicle movement simulation
- **Reset Button**: Return vehicle to starting position and reset timer
- **Speed Controls**: Choose from 0.5x (slow) to 4x (fast) simulation speeds

### Live Data Panel
- **Route Progress**: Visual progress bar showing completion percentage
- **Current Position**: Real-time GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)
- **Timestamp**: Current time from the route data
- **Speed**: Calculated vehicle speed in km/h
- **Elapsed Time**: Total simulation runtime

### Map Features
- **Vehicle Marker**: Blue circular marker showing current position
- **Completed Route**: Solid blue line showing the path already traveled
- **Full Route**: Dashed gray line showing the complete planned route
- **Interactive Controls**: Zoom and pan the map while simulation runs

### Help System
Click the **Help** button (blue circle with question mark) in the bottom-right corner for detailed instructions and feature explanations.

## 🗺️ Route Data Format

The application uses a JSON file with GPS coordinates and timestamps:

```json
[
  {
    "latitude": 17.385044,
    "longitude": 78.486671,
    "timestamp": "2024-07-20T10:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "latitude": 17.385145,
    "longitude": 78.486772,
    "timestamp": "2024-07-20T10:00:05Z"
  }
]
```

### Data Requirements
- **latitude**: GPS latitude coordinate (required)
- **longitude**: GPS longitude coordinate (required)
- **timestamp**: ISO 8601 timestamp (optional, used for speed calculation)

## 🎨 Design Features
